While an individual private school can choose the content and educational method to use, New York State mandates content and methods statewide. Some public schools have and continue to use established methods, such as Montessori for teaching such required content.

SEP Jin Shuren (; 1879\u20131941) was a Han Chinese born in Gansu, was the warlord governor of Xinjiang, succeeding Yang Zengxin when Yang was assassinated in 1928. Jin's rule of Xinjiang for about a half-decade was characterized by strife caused by corruption, suppression and disruption. Ethnic and religious conflicts were intensified and resulted in numerous riots against his regime and his eventual downfall. Jin confiscated the local Turkic lands in order to redistribute them to the Chinese, but he gave these lands to his personal associates. The deception caused the Chinese to become the targets of hatred. Jin also favored the Han over the Turkic (such as the Uighurs) and intensified ethnic conflicts between the Uighurs and Chinese. In April 1933 Jin's White Russian troops changed allegiance, encouraged revolt in Xinjiang, ended his reign and forced him to flee to the USSR. He was succeeded by Sheng Shicai. Jin incurred the wrath of the Kuomintang (KMT) when, without approval, he signed an arms treaty with the Soviet Union. Tungan Gen. Ma Zhongying allied himself with the KMT and his troops became the 36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). Ma was ordered to overthrow Jin. Jin was overthrown after the First Battle of Urumqi (1933) by White Russian troops under Col. Pappengut. When he returned to China in October 1933 he was arrested by the KMT, brought to trial in March 1935 and sentenced to 3-1\/2 years imprisonment. However, the KMT pardoned him on 10 October 1935 and he was released from prison the next day.

Brown suggests that many musical groups in Germany are adopting a sort of \u201csymbolic ethnicity\u201d which asserts that one \u201cdoes not necessarily have to be Turkish\u201d to assume the Turkish identity. Furthermore, a scholar named Dietmar Elfein has cited Da Crime Posse as an example of how the \u201cTurkish identity proposed is a mythological one\u201d in the sense that one did not necessarily have to be Turkish to assume this symbolic ethnicity. Perhaps one of the most important musical collaborations that Da Crime Posse has taken part in has been that with Karakan and Erci E. Cina-i Sebeke (of Da Crime Posse) was the individual who met fellow Turkish hip-hop artists Karakan and Erci-E and spurred their musical collaboration. Together, they established the legendary group Cartel and released a compilation album in 1995. The only single from their self-titled album, composed by Big Porno Ahmet, brought the biggest success in the history of Turkish hip-hop. With this unexpected success, they achieved Gold and Platinum status (plus many more awards) by selling more than 2,250,000 copies.

        "context":"START yes no SEP Tonality is the arrangement of pitches and\/or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality. In this hierarchy, the individual pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic. The root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (C\u2013E\u2013G). Simple folk music songs often start and end with the tonic note. The most common use of the term \"is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in European music from about 1600 to about 1910\" . Contemporary classical music from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality\u2014but harmony in almost all Western popular music remains tonal.

SEP Flaming beverages include cocktails and other mixed drinks that contain flammable, high-proof alcohol, which is ignited prior to consumption. The alcohol may be an integral part of the drink, or it may be floated as a thin layer across the top of the drink. The flames are mostly for dramatic flair. However, in combination with certain ingredients, the flavor of the drink is altered. Some flavors are enhanced, and it may impart a toasted flavor to some drinks. END",

There was interest by some members of the business community to modify the canal to support navigational uses, but the canal was never used for that purpose. SEP A caisson lock was invented in the late 18th century as a solution to minimise the use of great volumes of water required to raise and lower canal boats through large height differences. It was normal to only raise and lower boats through small height differences of a few feet when traversing undulating terrain. A solution was required when either large height differences were encountered or water was in short supply. The Caisson (or Caisoon) was thought to be one solution. The technology of the time was not capable of achieving this type of construction economically with current building materials. This design attempted was a type of canal lock in which a narrowboat is floated into a sealed watertight box and raised or lowered between two different canal water levels. It was designed primarily as a water-saving measure, and also was an attempt to minimise construction costs compared with other engineering solutions of the time. In use it was capable of replacing up to seven conventional locks. Other design benefits were speed of boat descent\/ascent, and only a little loss of water when operating compared with a conventional boat lock.
