These airway clearance techniques help people who have a spinal cord injury, cystic fibrosis, or another condition that makes it hard for mucus to drain from the lungs. When mucus collects in your lungs, it increases your risk for lung infections. Postural drainage uses gravity to help drain mucus into the mouth by placing the body in specific positions. Each position drains different areas (lobes) of the lung. The mucus can then be spit or coughed out. Chest percussion (chest physiotherapy) uses clapping of the chest with a cupped hand to vibrate the airways in the lungs. This vibration moves the mucus from smaller airways into larger ones where it can be coughed up.",

This may require a conscious effort if Parkinson's disease has diminished your movement; however, it will help you to maintain balance, posture, and reduce fatigue. Consciously lift your feet off of the ground when walking. Shuffling and dragging your feet may cause you to lose your balance. When trying to navigate turns, use a U technique of facing forward and making a wide turn, rather than pivoting sharply. Try to stand with your feet shoulder width apart. When your feet are close together for any length of time, you increase your risk of losing your balance and falling.",
